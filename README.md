Each year, wildfires devastate communities, causing widespread destruction due to insufficient resources and poor 
funding allocation for wildfire prevention. Additionally, strong winds often accompany wildfires, exacerbating property damage for homes and businesses.

That's Fire is a web-based platform that predicts wildfire trajectories using a self-trained machine-learning model. We visualize accurate predictions through heatmaps, aiding both civilians and first responders. By leveraging wildfire data, we enable analysis from environmental, economic, and social perspectives.

# Features
 - Wildfire Prediction â€“ Our machine-learning model forecasts wildfire trajectories based on global wildfire datasets.
 - Data Visualization â€“ Heatmaps display predictions for better situational awareness.
 - AI Chatbot (Trucky) â€“ Provides situational advice using real-time weather data and ML model output.
 - Web-Based Dashboard â€“ A fast and responsive interface for easy access to critical wildfire information.
